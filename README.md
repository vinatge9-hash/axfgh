- Header behavior includes a mobile hamburger menu
- Inline SVG icons for all icons
- Placeholder content and placeholder image references per requirements
- Accessibility-friendly semantic HTML structure

Notes:
- The current year in the footer is 2025.
- Image sources use placeholders, e.g., src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/570021/pexels-photo-570021.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" or background-image placeholders as requested.
- All pages include a scroll reveal animation using Tailwind classes.
- A small JavaScript snippet stores a contact form submission to localStorage on the contact page (demo purpose).
